# Fifth Element Somatics – QA Implementation Spec (Security + UX Fixes)

This QA spec summarizes critical and high-priority feedback from the user experience testing document and outlines implementation tasks for Replit AI to fix.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: SECURITY FIXES

### 🔐 1. Email Exposure in Developer Tools
- Issue: Submitted form emails are visible in browser dev tools.
- Pages affected:
  - /apply
  - /free-meditation
- ✅ Fix:
  - Remove direct email exposure from frontend form handlers.
  - Send email data only through a secure backend API route (POST → server).
  - Ensure responses from server do not echo user email in the response body.

---

### 🔒 2. Stripe Client Secret Exposure
- Issue: Stripe secret key is visible in browser JS or response payload.
- Location: /checkout
- ✅ Fix:
  - Remove all secret keys from frontend code.
  - Use Stripe’s [Checkout Session API](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/one-time) on server.
  - Pass `client_secret` securely via HTTPS API route using environment variables.
  - Never expose or commit secrets in frontend.

---

### 💳 3. Card Details in Headers
- Issue: Card data appears in browser network tab (headers/payload).
- ✅ Fix:
  - Use Stripe Elements or Checkout component.
  - Ensure PCI-compliant behavior: card data handled by Stripe, not custom input fields.
  - Never manually attach card numbers to requests.

---

## 🧠 FUNCTIONAL UX FIXES

### 🧮 4. Form Validation (Quiz & Apply Pages)
- Location: `/apply`, `/quiz`
- Issues:
  - Forms allow empty required fields.
  - Email validation only checks for `@`, accepts invalid addresses.
- ✅ Fix:
  - Add HTML5 required fields or JS validation on blur/change.
  - Use proper regex pattern for email:
    ```regex
    /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/
    ```
  - Disable submit until all validations pass.

---

### 🔁 5. Quiz Share Link is Broken
- Issue: Clicking “Share My Result” does not share quiz result.
- ✅ Fix:
  - Append quiz result data to the shared link URL (e.g., `/quiz?result=warrior`)
  - Update the quiz page to parse URL params and pre-fill or show correct result.
  - Alternatively: generate dynamic short URL with embedded result.

---

### 🚫 6. “Join the Waitlist” Button Doesn’t Work
- Location: `/about`
- ✅ Fix:
  - Check that the CTA is wired to correct form handler or modal.
  - Ensure all buttons are enabled and clickable.

---

### 🔁 7. Duplicate CTAs (Apply for Mentorship)
- Issue: “Apply” button appears multiple times on one page.
- ✅ Fix:
  - Consolidate into a single, high-impact CTA per page.

---

## 🔊 AUDIO CONTROL FIXES

### 🎧 8. Meditation or Quiz Audio Autoplay Bug
- Issue: Audio continues playing even when navigating between pages.
- ✅ Fix:
  - Tie audio to page/component lifecycle.
  - Use `useEffect()` cleanup or `onUnmount` to stop playback.
  - If using `<audio autoplay>`, replace with controlled JS player that stops on route change.

---

## 💰 CHECKOUT FLOW IMPROVEMENTS

### ⛔ 9. Payment Redirects Too Early
- Issue: Page redirects before email field is completed.
- ✅ Fix:
  - Ensure all required fields are filled before `Continue to Payment`.
  - Use button disabling and frontend validation.

---

### 🧾 10. Improve Checkout UX
- ✅ Fixes:
  - Keep navigation header visible on checkout pages
  - Check Apple Pay / Link Pay visibility
  - If Stripe integration allows it, surface quick pay buttons clearly
  - Confirm “Return to Body” bonus checkbox toggles correctly and updates pricing

---

## 🎨 UI POLISH TASKS

### 🎭 11. Home Icon Consistency
- Issue: Tiger logo blends well on dark pages but looks off on light pages.
- ✅ Fix:
  - Add alternate logo version for light backgrounds.
  - Detect scroll or page context to toggle icon color dynamically.

## 📘 Notes
- All sensitive actions must follow Stripe security best practices: [https://stripe.com/docs/security](https://stripe.com/docs/security)
- Dev team should confirm which pages include client-side email or card handling and refactor accordingly.
- Replit AI can assist in validating forms, mounting audio, and conditional UI rendering with tailwind/react.

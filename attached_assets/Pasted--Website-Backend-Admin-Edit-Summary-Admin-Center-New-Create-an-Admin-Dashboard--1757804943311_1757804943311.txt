## Data Model (MVP)
- [ ] `User(id, name, email, role, created_at)`
- [ ] `Tag(id, name)` / `UserTag(user_id, tag_id)`
- [ ] `Segment(id, rule_json)`
- [ ] `EmailTemplate(id, name, html)` / `EmailSend(id, to, subject, template_id, metrics...)`
- [ ] `Automation(id, graph_json)` / `AutomationRun(id, user_id, state)`
- [ ] `Course(id, title, slug, published)` / `Section(id, course_id, order)` / `Lesson(id, section_id, type, order, content_url)`
- [ ] `Offer(id, course_id, price_type, price_cents, interval)` / `Order(id, user_id, offer_id, status)`
- [ ] `Membership(id, user_id, course_id, access_starts_at, access_ends_at)`
- [ ] `Event(id, user_id, type, metadata, occurred_at)`

## Security & Compliance
- [ ] Role-based access control for admin routes
- [ ] Rate limiting, CSRF for forms, secure cookies/JWT
- [ ] Privacy policy & terms pages; data export/delete endpoints (GDPR)

## ✅ GLOBAL SITE CHANGES

### 🔁 Header + Navigation

- [ ] Replace top-left "580" placeholder with **Saint’s tiger logo** (SVG or PNG). Ensure it scales well across mobile and desktop.
- [ ] Change all navigation labels in the top-right menu to **ALL CAPS**.
  - `HOME`, `ABOUT`, `MASTERCLASS`, `TAKE THE QUIZ`
- [ ] Ensure navigation is **visible on all pages**, including:
  - Checkout
  - Quiz
  - Application pages
- [ ] When a user clicks a navigation item, the page should **scroll to the top** of that section (not the middle).

---

## 💳 CHECKOUT FLOW

### 🛠️ Stripe / Apple Pay Fixes

- [ ] Confirm **Apple Pay / Link** is enabled in Stripe settings.
- [ ] Display Apple Pay and Link buttons if available.
- [ ] Show these buttons **above or beside credit card input**.
- [ ] Ensure a **persistent site header** is displayed on the checkout page to allow easy navigation back to site content.

## 🎧 MEDITATION EXPERIENCE UPGRADE

### Interactive Audio + Visual Enhancements

- [ ] Add **toggleable captions** synced to Saint’s meditation voiceover.
- [ ] Add **simple visual slides or animations** that align with each part of the meditation (e.g., breath, grounding, body scan).
- [ ] When a user **navigates to a different page**, **stop the meditation audio** automatically.
- [ ] Add a **Download button** to let users save the meditation and transcript locally.
- [ ] Add **“Share this Meditation”** CTA to copy link or post to socials with a prefilled caption.

#### Suggested Visual Theme:

- Symbolic animation (leaves breathing, grounding roots, heart radiance)

## 💬 TESTIMONIALS SECTION

### Add CMS Management & Motion

  - Add / edit / delete testimonials

- [ ] Change static testimonial section to a **rotating carousel**:
  - Smooth fade animation
  - Auto-rotate every 6–8 seconds
  - Manual scroll controls

---

## 📸 VISUAL UPGRADES

- [ ] Each standalone page (e.g., Work With Me, Quiz, etc.) should feature a **unique photo of Saint** or relevant visual header
- [ ] Create a **media asset directory** in the Replit structure to store all site-wide photos

---

## 🌟 MASTERCLASS PAGE

### Media Preview Enhancements

- [ ] Add a **thumbnail preview image** for the masterclass
  - Optional: “Click to preview” overlay
  - Placeholder if Saint video isn’t ready
- [ ] Consider adding **audio narration** or **slideshow voiceover** that gives a preview of the class experience

---

## 📥 MISCELLANEOUS IMPROVEMENTS

- [ ] On pages like “Apply for Mentorship,” **remove duplicate CTAs** (i.e., don’t say “Apply” twice on the same screen)
- [ ] Add **Saint’s portrait** to the "Work With Me" application page for consistency
- [ ] All form pages should maintain **site header + footer**
- [ ] On quiz and meditation pages, ensure **audio/video doesn’t continue playing** once the user navigates away

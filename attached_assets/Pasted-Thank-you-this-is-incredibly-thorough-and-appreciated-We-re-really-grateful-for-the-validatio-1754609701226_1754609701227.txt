Thank you — this is incredibly thorough and appreciated. 🙏

We’re really grateful for the validation of the core feedback (especially around AI commands, navigation, and non-functional elements), and the transparency around what’s working, what’s half-implemented, and what needs deeper clarity.

Here’s how we’d like to respond:

✅ Fully agree on starting with Phase 1: Let’s fix what’s broken before building new. Having the AI command system actually generate content, seeing workshops persist, and being able to edit templates would immediately elevate the experience. We’re aligned here.

🎯 Clarifications from Saint:
	•	Yes, the goal with AI commands is to see real generated content appear — ideally as editable drafts with “accept,” “edit,” or “regenerate” buttons. Not just a toast that disappears. The content should show up immediately inside a visible workspace or preview.
	•	Workshop vs Landing Pages: We see your point — let’s keep Workshops for live/in-person events. But we also need a Landing Page Builder to promote general offers like meditations, lead magnets, or courses. So we do need both — can be two tools or one with a “Page Type” toggle.
	•	Email Flow Builder: Totally understand it’s a major feature. We’re okay putting this in Phase 3 — but we want to be sure the system we’re building today can grow into it (even with static blocks or triggers as a temporary UI).
	•	Email Interfaces: Ideally this all lives in one clean space. Whether campaigns, templates, sequences, or analytics — it’s easier if it’s all under one tab with internal tabs, rather than bouncing between disconnected pages.
	•	Settings Placement: While we understand top nav is common, it doesn’t feel intuitive here. Maybe “Settings” can live under a profile icon dropdown? We just want the flow to feel focused on creating, not configuring.

⸻

So yes — let’s begin by fixing the current implementation in Phase 1. Once those are working and visible, we can review the UI again and prioritize what comes next.

Thanks again — this gives us confidence in the architecture, and now we just need to connect the pipes and turn the lights on. 💡

Let us know when Phase 1 changes are live and we’ll test again immediately.

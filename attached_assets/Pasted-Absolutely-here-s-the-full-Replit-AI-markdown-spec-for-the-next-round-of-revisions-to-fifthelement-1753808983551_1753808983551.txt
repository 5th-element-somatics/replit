## 🎨 UI / LAYOUT UPDATES

### 🔗 Global Fixes

- [ ] Confirm bonus toggle dynamically updates checkout price

---

### 🧘 Free Grounding Meditation Page
- [ ] **Take the Quiz** should appear *before* “Explore the Masterclass” wherever they appear side-by-side

---

### 🧘‍♀️ Mentorship Page (/apply or /work-with-me)
- [ ] Add **more visual elements**:
  - Icons for each step (e.g. 🌀 for soul match, 📞 for intake call, 🔥 for embodiment path)
  - Multiple photos of Saint placed in-line or as section anchors
- [ ] Replace 1-2-3 steps with **section blocks + imagery**

## 🧠 AI-CREATION FLOW (PREP FOR FUTURE BUILDOUT)

- [ ] Enable prompt-based creation for:
  - Pages
  - Posts
  - Email campaigns
  - Meditation scripts

Example:
```text
“Create a new page called ‘Erotic Reclamation’ — include an intro paragraph, a masterclass CTA, and a footer with meditation link.”
